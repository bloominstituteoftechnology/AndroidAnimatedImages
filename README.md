# Android Animated Images

For this project you'll use at least 3 separate animated images use at least 1 of each kind. Allow the user to select and image or step through them and then start the animation. Be sure to use any extra time you have to experiment with shapeshifter.

## Goals
A page in your app with one of each of these types of image playing its animation

As yesterday's lecture went late only part 3 of this assignment will be required. However, if you have finished yesterday's assignment already, complete the other 2 parts.

1. An animated Gif (find a fun one online)
2. A animated drawable (find a gif and use a site like [this](https://ezgif.com/split), to split up and download the frames)
3. A button animated with an animated vector drawable that animates between two states when pressed (you'll need a button with 2 states and 2 animations, one for A to B and one for B to A)
> Remember a good naming convention for these is something to indicate it is animated (asset studio uses an avd prefix) and then the name of what it ends at, so a star going from empty to full would be avd_star_full.xml It doesn't really matter, just that you are clear about it

## Test

1. Make sure that you can switch between pages and that each animation plays

## Go further

Explore the demo animations in Shapeshifter and try and figure out how the more complicated animations are built.
